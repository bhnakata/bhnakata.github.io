## Members

## Overview

<p><i>The problem:</i> Students need study spaces, or want to try studying at a different place around campus.</p>

<p><i>The solution:</i> Create a website for all study spaces on UH Campus and list the resources of the study space. The resources listed by tags.</p>

## Mockup page ideas
<p>Create:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Landing Page</li>
  <li>Administrative Home Page</li>
  <li>User Home Page</li>
  <li>User profile page</li>
  <li>Full List of Study Spaces Page</li>
  <li>Study Place Proposal Form</li>
</ul>


## Use case ideas
<p>Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.</p>
<ul>
  <li>New User is taken to landing page. The landing page should give users 3 options of looking at the Full List of Study Spaces, allowed to search for a study space in a search by based on tag, or send a request to administrator to add a new study space to the website.</li> 
  <li>Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, able to view study space requests, and edits site.</li>
</ul>


## Beyond the basics

<p>The website will save the information of study places with a Card and store the image. The site will also hold a label which the search can recognize to help user's navigate a space.</p>
<p>The website will have a request form part which can only be viewed by admin.</p>
<p>Another method besides having admin implement study spaces is to allow user's to add their own study spaces.</p>
