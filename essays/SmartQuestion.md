# *How Smart Questions help engineers*

## What are Smart Questions?

#### Smart Questions is a technique of asking questions to get help to solve technical problems. To ask Smart Questions through online forums, it is important to be specific in what you are asking, and that the question relates to the place you're asking the question.

## How to determine if a question is a Smart Question?
#### According to [Eric Raymond and Rick Moen](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), smart questions are: 
##### - Specific about what is being asked. Such as stating the goal of the problem directly.
##### - Precise, and not open ended.
##### - Describe the problem in chronological order to better describe what went wrong at what time.
##### - Don't ask others to debug code unless you give a hint on what the problem is.
#### Questions that can be easily answered by looking into the manual, easily found on the internet search is not a smart question. Smart Questions is a way to better ask questions from experts to let experts understand the problem and help you understand the nature of the problem.
