# Coding Standards
*Coding Standard: An organized format of coding.*

## The Purpose of Coding Standard
The purpose of coding standard is to be able to write code in a certain way in order to make code easier to read and interpret to people. For example, indentation of code of a certain section of a function will make it easier to read.

Coding standards usually prefer naming varibles and functions to proper names to make it easier to identify the code. The usual way for coding standards in C is to name functions lowercased, unless it is more than one word. If it is more than one word to describe, then it will have the first word completely in lowercase, then the second word would have the first letter capitalized and the rest would be lowercased. An example of function naming would be 'purposeOfCodingStandard'.

## Experience with Coding Standard
Personally, I try to follow coding standards to make it easier to read. If I don't follow it while coding, then I try to finish the code then go back to follow coding standards. This is mainly because unless the coding standards practice is natural to coders, it will cause a break in train of thought. Which means it can slow down coding if the person coding doesn't follow them naturally.

# Conclusion
Coding standards are very important to follow, however it can cause coders not used to them to either slow down just to follow them, or coders will ignore it until the code is functioning properly. Then having to backtrack to make the code follow coding standards. However, the importance of coding standards can not be completely ignored, otherwise all code would be very hard to comprehend to anyone that is not the original author.
