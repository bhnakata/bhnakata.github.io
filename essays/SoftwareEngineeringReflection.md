<h1>What is software engineering?</h1>
<p>
  Software engineering is basically about how to code, so that machines can execute tasks the user desire. Computer programs today are becoming increasingly complex as time goes by due to different purpose and structures of code.
  Code today can do a lot more with AI(artificial intelligence) which can help people easily analyze and pull up more information about topics in less time than it takes a person to do the research on a topic.
  This can lead to some ethical changes of what is considered personal work due to being able to just ask an AI for an answer. Then users can just take the AI's answer as their own. What I find to be the most important
  parts of learning programming is functional programming and design patterns.
