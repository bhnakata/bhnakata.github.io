*JavaScript: an object-oriented programming language.*

JavaScript as an object-oriented programming language is very versatile. It can be used in ways that C++ can not be used. Such as being able to assign a true or false value to a character. This was shown in the ‘IsUnique’ module. The WODs are very useful to better understand how JavaScript works as a programming language. Even though it is stressful to code in a time limit. I think it is helpful to try and practice the WODs because it helps me think of the process of programming. I think JavaScript can be used more easily when starting from scratch, however it will be more difficult to comprehend already existing code. This is because there are many features that easily overlap, which increase the difficulty. For example in C++, to create a function that can only accept certain types of code of ‘int’, ‘char’, ‘signed’, etc. The function will only work properly when given a certain type of value. The ‘int’ will only accept numbers, while the ‘char’ will accept characters. In JavaScript, the labels for data type can be vague. This means you can create a function that can accept any type of input. Whether it be a character, string, or number. This makes it easier to create a function that needs less care about the input value which can be used in more ways.
There is also the new ES6 content for JavaScript which makes it easier to understand. The ‘let’ data type basically makes a variable that can be declared once. Which is the same in a lot of other languages. The ‘let’ can be a string, character, integer, or like a floating point number. Overall I’m not really familiar with all changes to ES6 compared to previous iterations of JavaScript since I just started learning JavaScript. In order to better understand JavaScript, it will be important to constantly practice. The athletic software engineering module to practice is very useful to follow. Learning the basics of coding step by step for different parts can be used to understand how code can work. Which will improve coding experience that can be used at other times.
Overall, JavaScript is a good programming language to build code. JavaScript can be versatile in how it handles variables, but needs to take in consideration of variables storing different data types. 


## In the context of programming

In the context of programming, this has always been true. The difficult problems have always been different, although changes in technology can change the landscape quite a bit. "Business" type applications are the things that come to mind for me. Those types of applications are usually coupled in some way with people ... and people are awfully hard to deal with!

Consider that one of the most popular content management systems is also considered the most horrible - Wordpress. But really, is there anything that fills that need? If it was so easy in the first place, where is the solution? Where's the magic CMS that is designed well enough that everyone hops on the boat to use it?

Some things are just difficult - building applications that humans use is hard, and will probably be hard for at least the near future.

## In the context of engineering

Ever hear people ragging on engineering companies for delivering late and way over budget? Well, some engineering jobs are really difficult, especially if the requirements and funding are undulating underneath you. Because of the nature of the problem, sometimes engineering firms require large amounts of engineers and workers, inviting further problems and delays.

The Honolulu Rail project at home has become this sort of poster child of failure, budget overrun and overall incompetence in Hawaii. Well, working though regulatory boards and fiscal procedures in Hawaii seems like it's a mind bogglingly difficult job to do. Granted, there might be some fishy stuff going on, but I refuse to believe that everyone is involved for nefarious reasons.

The problem of creating an unprecedented public transportation backbone on an island is difficult! I'm not sure we would have done it right, even if the best people were involved.

## In the context of relationships

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
